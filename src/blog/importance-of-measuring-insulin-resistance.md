title: The importance of measuring insulin resistance
---

Metabolic health, or as often called, metabolic flexibility, is commonly

characterized by measuring insulin resistance (IR). The basic definition

of IR is the alteration of observed nutrient clearance speed from the

blood. I say observed, because any snapshot level is the result of

processes that remove, but also of those that add nutrients to the

blood. Due to the highly dynamic nature of nutrient levels, any single

measurement provides limited information. Often, determining the

concentrations of two or more molecules that are in a close

relationship, but delayed in time, can provide additional input to

confer the underlying dynamics. Moreover, deterioration of fasting and

postprandial (= after meal) levels of nutrients and hormones can be

largely disconnected.

​

In line with this, different fasting metrics have been developed over

the decades, the rule of thumb being that beyond the basic marker of

glucose metabolism --glucose itself-- inclusion of the regulating

hormones, especially insulin, and a marker of lipid metabolism, either

triglycerides (TG) or free fatty acids (FFA), provides the best

correlation to dynamic postprandial profiling done in a research

laboratory (the gold standard being the HEC: hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic

clamp). However, these more complex fasting metrics add significant

cost, while still leave out up to 50 % (!) of people, who are diagnosed

by the HEC as IR, usually as false negatives, sometimes as false

positives. Therefore, the ideal measurement is both postprandial and

includes insulin (and lipids). This has been traditionally difficult to

achieve en-mass not only at the point-of-care (PoC, but even at bigger

university hospitals. I hope dear reader that it's not surprising by now

that the main goal of the Meterbolic project is to make these

measurements accessible and feasible not only at PoC, but also at home

settings.

​

Consequently, our recommended measurements were developed following the

above logic, and can be found in the table below. We will release

consecutive blog posts discussing the most important ones, and the ones

that are unique or are seemingly unusual, adding supporting scientific

evidence for each.
