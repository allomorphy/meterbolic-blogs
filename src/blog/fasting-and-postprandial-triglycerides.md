## Lipid Series Part I -- Metabolism Basics
I’m going to summarize fasting metrics very briefly and then expand on postprandial measurement here and I will leave in-depth discussion on the `TriglYceride-Glucose index` (TyG) to *Lipid Series Part II*. 

To better understand lipid, and more specifically, triglyceride metabolism, it is difficult to recommend a single review. There is of course the 4th edition of the fantastic book by *Prof. Keith N. Frayn* (of Oxford University) [^1], but that is not a short and simple update if that is what you need. Perhaps a good enough introduction would be the book chapter “*Introduction to Lipids and Lipoproteins*” by Feingold and Grunfeld in the free Endotext [^2]. If you are already there, another chapter provides further insight into triglyceride metabolism and the risks associated with elevation in both fasting and postprandial triglycerides: *“Risk of Fasting and Non-Fasting Hypertriglyceridemia in Coronary Vascular Disease and Pancreatitis*” [^3].

In general, the level of fasting triglycerides correlates well with the corresponding insulin level, and with `Insulin Resistance` (IR). This is also why TyG is a good proxy for IR, providing a cheap and convenient metric like HOMA-IR. However, the TyG index has the very same issues that other fasting indices do in that it is unable to detect the majority of early metabolic derangements. To pick up these, one needs a *postprandial* or meal tolerance test. As fatty acid uptake is an early indicator of IR, elevated and/or the sustained elevation of triglyceride level may be assessed in the postprandial phase.

*Why is reduced lipid uptake by adipose tissue an early indicator of IR?* 

One of the major metabolically active organs is `White Adipose Tissue` (WAT).  The hallmark of metabolic disease is *ectopic* lipid accumulation* (i.e. the collection of lipid in places where it normally hardly appears) which typically results from WAT dysfunction. In fact, this defect may be *the single direct driver of all other manifestations of IR* as we know it.

In other words, when lipids cannot be safely stored in WAT to the extent that it is required by the demands of diet and metabolic status, fatty acids overflow to other organs [^4]. These could theoretically also store more lipids in a safe way, but the aforementioned flood of fatty acids does not arrive alone, but is accompanied by *inflammatory signalling molecules*, hormones (e.g. higher leptin and visfatin, and lower adiponectin), and higher levels of cytokines (e.g. elevated portal IL-6), originating from the stressed-out main storage organ, the liver [^5]. What is more, pre-adipocytes have been shown to leave WAT and find a new home as mature fat cells in ectopic organs, such as skeletal muscle [^6]. The net effects of these factors represent the most likely causal problem for the preciously mentioned ectopic deposition of lipids and the initiation of local inflammation and IR [^7].

There are two main transport forms of fatty acids in the blood. 1)`Free Fatty Acids` (FFA) travel after liberation from adipose tissues in the blood (bound to albumin as a carrier) to organs that use the FFA as a fuel or 2) the liver esterifies the FFA by bonding it to a glycerol molecule to form Triglycerides and subsequently repackages the insoluble triglyceride it into lipoprotein, mainly VLDL particles. This form, as well as the repackaged and chylomicron contained fatty acids are triglycerides (TG or TAG, the latter being short for triacyl-glycerol), comprising the second main type of circulating fats.
Below graphs are taken from [^4] and nicely depict lipid and glucose dynamics after three mixed meals over a day.

Although triglycerides are often considered a transport form, these glycerol-bound fatty acids can be 

> ~~liberated~~
> broken down

not only ~~at~~ in adipose tissues for uptake and storage, but also ~~at~~ in other tissues and organs, for instance the heart and skeletal muscles. In fact, there is a constant cycling between metabolically active organs, i.e. the liver, adipose tissues, and the small intestine, ensuring proper availability by increasing or dropping the rate of cycling. This cycling also plays important signaling roles via different fatty acid profiles and derivatives (sphingolipids) that characterize release at various tissues [^8]. (As outlined in Section VIII of the ~~mentioned~~ referenced review [^8], metabolic diseases are always accompanied by disturbances in glycerolipid cycling. `It is likely that` some or most of these ~~being~~ are even initiated by disruption of ~~the~~ this cycle). <I put this in braces because I did not know what the glycerolipid family was until now and I thought that this point is not essential to the main thread>

Even though knowing its dynamics may be at least as meaningful, measuring FFA is technically difficult even in a ~~clinical~~  laboratory setting. Instead, `we routinely measure`TG ~~are routinely determined~~ in the fasting state and as mentioned ~~but can be~~ may also be measured and interpreted in the postprandial phase ~~as well~~. ~~At this time, ~~ We are interested in the utility of determining postprandial TG levels, or in other words its dynamics. Lipid metabolism is a bit trickier than that of glucose, in that fatty acids do not simply pass through the intestinal wall. While glucose take-up by intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells) results in a closely corresponding increase in blood, FFA (and monoacyl-glycerol), which are taken up from the intestinal lumen, are first converted back to TG and can be stored in the form of lipid droplets within enterocytes, and only released later. In line with this, the first wave of chylomicrons (lipoproteins secreted by enterocytes containing ApoB-48 proteins) often contain lipids from the previous meal, not from the just ingested one. This makes levels and dynamics a bit less well correlated to the meal under examination, but not to the extent that values could become of no or little use. In fact, postprandial lipid dynamics is closely related to changes in glucose, but the latter can be masked by a non-stressing mixed meal.

Technically, the microdialysis study by McQuaid et al. [^4], which is still one of my absolute favorites, and from which above series of graphs are borrowed, showed that in visceral obesity (= IR) there are three parameters that correlate very closely in adipose tissues following a mixed meal: blood flow, glucose extraction, and TG uptake. Note the order, as it is likely very important. The conclusion we can draw based on this is that WAT insulin resistance, which may manifest mainly as decreased blood flow, results in a reduced (impaired?) uptake of glucose via the GLUT4 pathway. Although not directly, this pathway is linked to fatty acid re-esterification (synthesis and storage of TG), because glycerol cannot be recycled in WAT due to lack of a key enzyme, so it has to be synthesized via glyceroneogenesis, a process that shares several enzymes with the gluconeogenic pathway, reviewed in [^9].

The ultimate problem is that if there is a disturbance in glucose uptake into WAT it is automatically linked to reduced glycerol synthesis and eventually to impaired lipid storage. Lower storage, higher overflow in the blood and in other tissues, triggering inflammatory processes, and finally, ectopic deposition. Proper glucose uptake is more important in adipose tissues, as shown by specific KO models, than in skeletal muscle, despite the one order of magnitude lower level of absolute uptake [^10]. This is an ultimate signaling hub, and as such, quality trumps quantity. Insulin must follow the increased need for suppressing lipolysis to avoid direct and immediate lipotoxicity, but higher insulin has minimal effect on re-esterification of FA to TG [^11] and see Fig.4. from that paper attached]

Since, unlike muscles for glucose, there is no backup plan for massive amounts of dietary fats, all in all, above highlight the importance and utility of monitoring lipid uptake after a meal. And that’s exactly where TG come into the picture. The expectation therefore is that in insulin resistant individuals, TG reach higher peaks and linger around longer than in insulin sensitive people, following the reduction in uptake to WAT, as discussed above.

(Unit conversion for TG: 1 mmol/L = 88.5 mg/dL, or use a calculator, e.g. this one: https://unitslab.com/node/53)
